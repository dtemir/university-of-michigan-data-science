In [Assignment #2](assignment2.ipynb), we process data with **Python's Pandas** to answer questions on children immunization based on [CDC data](assets/NISPUF17.csv).

## Week 3 - More Data Processing with Pandas

In [Assignment #3](assignment3.ipynb), we answer a bunch of questions with with **Python's Pandas and Numpy** based on [energy data](assets/Energy Indicators.xls), [wolrd bank data](assets/world_bank.csv), and [country rank](assets/scimagojr-3.xlsx).
